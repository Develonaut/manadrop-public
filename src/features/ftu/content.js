  `<strong>We've launched!!!</strong> We're incredibly excited to share Manadrop with you, but please remember Manadrop is still in BETA, which means things can get...weird. We hope they don't but if they do join the <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #bc73ff" href="https://discord.gg/y3hXtbN" target="_blank">Discord</a> to reach out!`,
  `<strong>Check out the starter collection.</strong> We thought it would be nice to show how the BETA version of Manadrop works with a starter collection. Feel free to remove it as it's not permanent.`,
  `<strong>All your data is on your device.</strong> All your collection data is local and lives on your device, which allows you to access it offline and have it at an instant. Whatever you do, DON'T CLEAR YOUR APPLICATION DATA. Clearing any application data will cause all your hard work to be lost, and we won't be able to recover it.`,
  `<strong>So much more to come!</strong> What you see is just the beginning we have so many more features to introduce like Importing, Exporting, Clouds Saves, Cross-Device Support, and so much more!`
